            <h1>Red Hot Chili Peppers</h1>

            

            <div class="text"><div class="container"><p><br>Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1983. The group's musical style primarily consists of rock with an emphasis on funk, as well as elements from other genres such as punk rock and psychedelic rock. When
                played live, their music incorporates elements of jam band due to the improvised nature of many of their performances. Currently, the band consists of founding members vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea (Michael Peter Balzary), longtime
                drummer Chad Smith, and former touring guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. <br>Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time with over 80 million records sold worldwide, have been nominated for sixteen Grammy Awards, of which
                they have won six, and are the most successful band in alternative rock radio history, currently holding the records for most number-one singles (13), most cumulative weeks at number one (85) and most top-ten songs (25) on the Billboard
                Alternative Songs chart.[1] In 2012, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band's original lineup, originally named Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, featured guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer
                Jack Irons, alongside Kiedis and Flea. Because of commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's self-titled debut album (1984). Slovak performed on the second and third albums, Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift
                Mofo Party Plan (1987), but he died from a heroin overdose in 1988. As a result of his friend's death, Irons chose to leave the group. After short-lived replacements on guitar and drums, John Frusciante and Chad Smith joined in 1988. The
                lineup of Flea, Kiedis, Frusciante, and Smith was the longest-lasting and recorded five studio albums beginning with Mother's Milk (1989). In 1990, the group signed with Warner Bros. Records and recorded the album Blood Sugar Sex Magik
                (1991) under producer Rick Rubin. This album became the band's first major commercial success, but Frusciante grew uncomfortable with the band's popularity and left abruptly in 1992 in the middle of the Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour. (wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers)</p></div>

                <h2>Techniques</h2> 
                <div class="container"><p>Red Hot Chili Peppers' musical style has been characterized as funk rock, alternative rock, funk metal and rap rock, with influences from hard, psychedelic and punk rock. The band's influences include Defunkt, Parliament-Funkadelic, Jimi Hendrix, the Misfits, Black Sabbath, Metallica, James Brown, Gang of Four, Bob Marley, Big Boys, Bad Brains, Sly and the Family Stone, Ohio Players, Queen, Stevie Wonder, Elvis Presley, Deep Purple, the Beach Boys, Black Flag, Ornette Coleman, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Fugazi, Fishbone, Marvin Gaye, Billie Holiday, Santana, Elvis Costello, the Stooges, the Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees,Devo, and Miles Davis.

Kiedis provided multiple vocal styles. His primary approach up to Blood Sugar Sex Magik was spoken verse and rapping. Complemented with traditional vocals, he helped the band maintain a consistent style. As the group matured, notably with Californication (1999) the group reduced the number of rapped verses. By the Way contained only two songs with a rap-driven-verse/melodic chorus form. Kiedis' more recent style was developed through ongoing coaching.<br>

Original guitarist Slovak's style was strongly based on blues and funk. Slovak was primarily influenced by hard rock artists such as Hendrix, Kiss and Led Zeppelin. His playing method was highly based on improvisation, a style commonly used in funk music. He also was noted for his aggressive playing style; he would often play with such force, that his fingers would "come apart". Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, with Slovak adopting a more fluid style featuring "sultry" elements as opposed to his original hard rock techniques. On The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987), Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal.His guitar riffs would often serve as the basis of the group's songs, with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work. His melodic riff featured in the song "Behind the Sun" inspired the group to create "pretty" songs with an emphasis on melody.<br>Kiedis describes the song as "pure Hillel inspiration". Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as "Green Heaven" and "Funky Crime", in which he would sing into a tube while playing to create psychedelic effects.(wiki/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers)</p></div>

                <p>The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame In April 2012. The induction lineup was Kiedis,
     Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (who was represented by his brother James), Irons and Martinez; Frusciante did not attend, though he
    was invited. Dave Navarro and Jack Sherman were not inducted; Sherman said he felt "dishonored". The band performed three songs; 
    "By the Way", "Give it Away" and "Higher Ground", which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis
    and Flea had performed with Irons in 24 years and Martinez in 26 years. In 2012, three of the band's albums Blood Sugar Sex Magik, 
    Californication, and By the Way were ranked among Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time ranked at 310, 399,
    and 304 respectively.</p>

                <p>The Getaway, the band's eleventh studio album, was released on June 17, 2016. Produced by Danger Mouse. Featuring the singles "Dark Necessities," "Go Robot," "Sick Love" & "Goodbye Angels."
                The Getaway World Tour concluded in October 2017. The tour consisted of 151 shows lasting a year and almost five months. In December, the band headlined the Band Together 2 Benefit Concert at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Money raised from the concert goes to the Tipping Point Emergency Relief Fund which since 2005 has raised $150 million to educate, employ, house and support those in need in the Bay Area.
                Work on a new album was announced in September 2018, with plans to release it sometime in 2019. The recording was delayed due to 
                the Woolsey Fire; the band performed a benefit show for fire victims on January 13, 2019.
                  The band performed "Dark Necessities" with rapper Post Malone at the 61st Grammy Awards on February 10, 2019.</p>
