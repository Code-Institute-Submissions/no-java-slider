Project's Name: Red Hot Chili Pepper
(nojava-script slider, music-band website)

The project's target is to provide a website for a music-band, with some information about the band itself, images, audio and video sampels of the band's music.
In my case this band is a world famous rock band, so at my project the visitors can follow the band 2019 tour around the globe and have a chance to buy tickets to the concerts.

UX

This website is for those visitors who are looking for entertaintment around the world and heard about this fantastic and populare rock-punk band. Free sampels of audio and video songs to gat attention of the visitors and video record about the biggest achivement of the band to get in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!
Visitors who found the band interesting and feel to travell to one of their concert can get acces to buy tickets for the concerts.
If someone willing to fill up the section for tickets information, get real-time info about availability and costs of the tickets through e-mail. This way the website owner can keep records about potential buyers for future events.
As the website visitors numbers grow can be built a members only page with registration and exclusive informations about not only concerts but every events where the band apperance is possible. This way can build a strong followers database.
The bottom section (footer) provide the social media apperance for more optional following and registrations.

My first idea was to use HTML and CSS language only (HTML5, CSS3) and try to avoid Javascript coding because this is the first project in the Code Institute programme and this point we haven't cover this subject. 
The parallax methode and the image slider section can be made without Javascript (found solution on internet), but the user centric navbar, the modal section and some basic animation can not be made without it. 
Used as less as I can.
I have used Bootstrap framework for developing responsive, mobile-first website with Font-awesome.

The website continously tested with Google Inspect and HTML, CSS (W3C)validator.

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
•	As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features
•	Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
•	...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
Features Left to Implement
•	Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
•	JQuery
o	The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
1.	Contact form:
i.	Go to the "Contact Us" page
ii.	Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
iii.	Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
iv.	Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
•	Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
•	Different configuration files?
•	Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
