## (No java-script slider, music-band website)

The project's aim is to provide a website for a music-band, with some information about the band itself, images, audio and video samples of the band's music and opportunity for the visitors to sign up for more details.

My first idea was to use HTML and CSS language only (HTML5, CSS3) and try to avoid JavaScript coding because this is the first project in the Code Institute program and this point we haven't cover this subject. 
The parallax method and the image slider section can be made without JavaScript (found solution on internet), but the user centric navbar, the modal section and some basic animation cannot be made without it. 
Used as less as I can.
I have used Bootstrap framework for developing responsive, mobile-first website with Font-awesome.

In this case the band is a world famous rock band, so in my project the visitors can follow the band 2019 tour around the globe and buy concert tickets via links to the relevant sales website.
UX
This website is for those visitors who are looking for entertainment around the world and know or either never heard about this fantastic and popular rock-punk band. Free samples of audio and video songs to catch attention of the visitors. 
Visitors who found the band interesting and feel to travel to one of their concert can  buy tickets for the concerts.
+Users who never heard about this band can experience audio, video, text and images (gallery)
+Users who interested to go to the band concerts can buy tickets via links
+Users who did not decided yet can sign up for further information or require info at contact page  
If someone willing to fill up the section for tickets information, get real-time info about availability and costs of the tickets through e-mail. This way the website owner can keep records about potential buyers for future events.
I have used paper mockups for the layout unfortunately didn’t keep records.
